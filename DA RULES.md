DAIJOGO is a game programmed by Alexandre Nasajon and developed in conjunction with his friends. It is heavily (and I mean HEAVILY) influenced by Magic: the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pok√©mon TCG, Hearthstone, Faeria and other games like those. Lots os elements in DAIJOGO are copies of some elements from those games, so I don't expect to make any money out of DAIJOGO at this point.

Number of players: 2

Duration of a match: 5-10 minutes

Fun: lots of fun

1 - How to win the game

  Each player begins the game with 100 life. If at the end of any turn a player has less than 1 life, that player loses the game. If both players have less than 1 life, then the match is a draw.
  
2 - Starting the game

  The players must choose who will be Player 1 and who will be Player 2. Player 1 starts the game, but doesn't draw a card in the first turn.
  Then each player chooses a deck to play with. Each deck has its own strategy and unique cards, so choose wisely.
  After both players have chosen their decks, the game begins.
  Each player starts with their respective decks, both with 30 cards, and draws five cards from them. Players alternate in turns until one of them loses the game. At the beginning of each player's turn, that player draws a card from their deck and receives 1 gold. Then that player may play cards from their hand, attack with units or activate abilities. When that player has no more actions to take or simply wishes to end their turn, that player must select the option " End turn".
  
3 - Game Zones

    3.1 - Deck
      Each player starts the game with a deck of 30(thirty) cards.
      Whenever a player must draw a card, that player draws a card from their respective deck.
      
    3.2 - Hand
      Each player starts the game with five cards in hand.
      Each player can only see the cards in their own hand, meaning they won't know what cards are in their opponent's hand.
      Players may play cards from their hands. Each card has a card type that determines where that card goes when played.
      
    3.3 - Field
      Each player has their own field, where that player's unit cards go if played.
      A player may select one of their units on the field to attack. If that unit has an ability, then that player may INSTEAD choose to activate that unit's ability.
      If a unit on the field is destroyed, that unit is sent to it's controller's graveyard.
      
    3.4 - Graveyard
      Each player has their own graveyard. Cards are sent to the graveyard in the following situations:
      - If a card is destroyed;
      - If an ally has no loyalty left;
      - After a spell is cast and its effect already happened;
      - After a support is cast and its effect already happened;
      - If a card is discarded from a player's hand;
      - If an effect makes a card go to the graveyard.
    
  4 - Player's turn
    DAIJOGO is a turn based game; the turn structure is simple: the turn player may play cards from their hand and/or attack with units and/or activate their card's abilities. When that player can no longer perform any actions or simply doesn't wish to perform another action that turn, then that player must select the option "End turn", which will activate card effects that are only activated at the end of the turn. If there are no cards with effects that activate at the end of the turn, then the turn ends and the other player's turn begins.
    
    4.1 - Play a card
      To play a card, the player must select a card from their hand and then select the option "Play".
      If the player has an amount of gold equal or higher than that card's cost, then an amount of gold equal to that card's cost will be taken from him and the card will be played. If a unit card is played, it is summoned on that player's field. If an ally card is played, it is called on that player's room. If a totem card is played, it is built on that player's temple. If a spell or support card is played, it is cast then sent to that player's graveyard.
      
    4.2 - Attacking with a unit
      To reduce your opponent's life to zero, you must attack with your units!
      Each unit has its own power.
      To attack, the player must select a unit under their control to attack.
      That unit can attack the opponent or a unit that opponent controls.
      If that unit attacks the opponent, then that player will lose life equal to the unit's power.
      If that unit attacks an enemy unit:
        If the attacking unit has power greater than the enemy unit, then the enemy unit will be destroyed.
        If the attacking unit has power equal to the enemy unit, then both will be destroyed.
        If the attacking units has power less than the enemy unit, then the attacking unit will be destroyed.
     Each unit can only attack or activate an ability once per turn.
     
    4.3 - Graveyard
      If a card goes to the graveyard, that card can no longer be played, unless an effect adds that card to another zone.
      
    4.4 - End turn
      When a player end their turn, all "at end of turn" effects activate at the same time, but each will resolve in a specified order:
      1 - Totem effects, starting with the first totem built;
      2 - Unit effects, starting with the first unit summoned;
      3 - Unit in the graveyard effects, starting with the first unit that was sent there.
      After all "at end of turn" effects resolve, the player's turn will end and the other player will draw a card and receive 1 gold, starting their next turn.
